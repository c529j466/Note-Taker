# Note-Taker

## Description


For this project, I was tasked with creating a the back end functionality for a note taker app and then deploying it on Heroku. The project needed multiple routes for GET, POST, and DELETE options as well as the functionality to assign ids to each note. The page functioned in that when a user types a note title and body, the note is saved to the sidebar when they click the save icon, and if the user hits the delete icon, the note is removed.  My motivation to complete this project was to better understand how to create routes and functionality for the back end of an application as well as how everything comes together in terms of front end and back end functionality. 

## Installation

To install the note taker, I used the given html, css, and javascript documents to create a server.js document that would add the needed back end functionality to the page. I then created a github repository, cloned that repository to my local device, copied the code files to the repository, pushed the files to the repository on github, and then deployed the repository code to Heroku.
